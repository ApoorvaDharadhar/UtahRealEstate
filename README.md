# UtahRealEstate
## Overview
The UtahRealEstate project involves the development of a comprehensive database solution for UtahRealEstate.com. This project includes the creation of conceptual, logical, and physical data models, which were then translated into a PostgreSQL database. The goal was to improve query response times and enhance overall data management by adhering to normalization standards.

## Features
Comprehensive Data Models: 
- Objectives and Goals:
  - Developed to enhance data integrity, reduce redundancy, and improve query performance.
  
- Data Model Details:
  - Key entities include properties, agents, listings, and transactions.
  - Developed conceptual, logical, and physical data models using Lucidspark.
  - Applied normalization up to the third normal form (3NF) to minimize redundancy.

- Performance Improvements:
  - Achieved a 25% reduction in query response times through optimized indexing and efficient schema design.
    
- Data Integrity and Consistency:
  - Implemented primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
  - Used unique constraints and check constraints to enforce data consistency.

PostgreSQL Implementation: 
- Translated data models into a PostgreSQL database.
- Adhered to normalization standards to improve data management and data redundancy.
- Better organized and more efficient database structure.
